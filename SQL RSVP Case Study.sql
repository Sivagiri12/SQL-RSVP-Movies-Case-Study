-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:
SELECT table_name, table_rows
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'imdb';








-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:
desc movie








-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)

-- Q4. How many movies were produced in the USA or India in the year 2019??

Exploring table Genre would be fun!! 
Let’s find out the different genres in the dataset.*/

-- Q5. Find the unique list of the genres present in the data set?
-- Type your code below:
SELECT DISTINCT genre  FROM genre  ;









/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie of one of these genres.
Now, wouldn’t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?
Combining both the movie and genres table can give more interesting insights. */

-- Q6.Which genre had the highest number of movies produced overall?
-- Type your code below:
